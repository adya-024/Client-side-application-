Overview

This project is a Java-based multithreaded client-side chat application that allows users to communicate with a central server and other connected clients in real-time. It is built using Java sockets and threading, ensuring seamless two-way communication with high responsiveness.



 Features

- Multithreaded Client Handling: The client can send and receive messages simultaneously through separate threads for input and output.
- Real-Time Communication: Enables live chat with other users connected to the server.
- Simple Command-Line Interface: Easy to use and navigate, with clean input/output prompts.
- Server-Client Architecture: Designed to work with a Java server that handles multiple clients concurrently.
- Error Handling: Includes basic exception handling to manage connectivity issues and input/output errors.

 

 Future Enhancements

We aim to improve the client application with the following features:

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Build a Swing-based or JavaFX GUI for better usability.
- Private Messaging:** Allow clients to send direct messages to specific users.
- Message Encryption: Add basic encryption for secure communication.
- Chat History: Store and display previous chat messages.
- Typing Indicator & User Status: Show when someone is typing or online/offline.
