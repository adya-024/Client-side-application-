Overview

This project is a **Java-based multithreaded client-side chat application** that allows users to communicate with a central server and other connected clients in real-time. It is built using Java sockets and threading, ensuring seamless two-way communication with high responsiveness.

This client-side utility is ideal for developers and learners interested in understanding how real-time messaging systems function, while practicing multithreading and network programming in Java.
